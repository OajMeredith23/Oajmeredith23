# Hi, I'm Oliver Meredith 🐙

A front-end developer that builds upon a foundation in design. Creator of interesting, exciting digital experiences that build upon an education in UI/UX Design and 5 years experience using a variety of different web technologies. 

🎓 I'm just about to graduate from a BA(Hons) degree in UX/UI at Ravensbourne University London. 

🕵️‍ I'm looking for work as a front-end developer either remote or in/around London. 

✍️ I believe in idea-first learning. Not learning technology for the sake of itself, but to build cool stuff. This means being adaptable, flexible, and knowing how to learn quickly!
